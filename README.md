The dataset contents Olympic Athlete data from the year 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. Where i have distributed the data into two categories i.e. Male athlete and Female athlete;
From these two categories i have created 2 inactive dashboard which are interlinked to each other and used proper formating and charts to showcase various information. 
In these dashboard,
1. I have shown per year events mention above in four tiles.
2. I have used Slicer on the medals and teams where you can see how each team have perform in the particular year
   and how many medals have they achived in that event.
